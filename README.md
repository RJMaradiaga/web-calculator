# web-calculator

Howdy. My name is Ryan Maradiaga and in this project, I'm trying to make a simple calculator using html, css, and javascript, with the goal of getting a better understanding of these three languages. Eventually, I'd like to use the github server to host this webpage. <br>
<br>

I don't want to set really high goals for this project because that seems both daunting and detrimental to my progress, however, I will do the best that I can throughout this summer before I attend college.<br>

# for-myself

<br>
There is a high chance that the only person that will see this is the future me so I just wanted to say a couple things. It's 7/3/21 and you're super stressed out about the breakup (yes, a month after and you're still messed up) even more than you're stressed about college. That's not to say that you don't care about college, it's just that you were always confident on the school side of things and it's hard losing one of the most amazing friends you've ever had. <br>
<br>

So, whether you're in another rut or you've moved onto bigger and better things, I just wanted to say that I hope you can be grateful for the people that have made an impact on your life. And most importantly, take pride in being you. Buenas noches, futuro.
